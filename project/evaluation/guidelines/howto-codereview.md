## Submitting your code reviews

1. download a copy of the code review document from the Google Sheet sent by the TAs,
2. make sure that all members of the team understand the evaluation criteria,
3. perform the code review and fill the document individually,
4. discuss about the differences in your evaluations and summarize your conclusions as a team in a single code review document,
5. generate the pdf with the same filename as the original document (e.g. b1pdndt1.pdf - peer review evaluations),
6. send the document to ift6759@mila.quebec with the filename as the object.
